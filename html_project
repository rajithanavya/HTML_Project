	<h1> Beautiness of a butterfly </h1>

	<div class="content">
	<p>“We delight in the beauty of the butterfly, but rarely admit the changes it has gone through to achieve that beauty”.
Butterflies' special place in human culture stems from the fact that they have used their wings not only for flight, but as a canvas for some of the most striking patterns in nature. Evolving from an ancestral moth-like insect about 60 million years ago, the sheer beauty of their wings, and the metaphorical power of their emergence fully formed from rather unpromising pupae, has made butterflies an object of admiration and inspiration.

	To highlight the beauty of change, consider the life cycle of the monarch butterfly. WPC’s bumble bee recovery team has spent a lot of time at Pinery Provincial Park in Ontario this summer looking for bumble bees, and while doing so, we can’t help but stop and enjoy all of the beauty that nature has to offer. We have been able to observe and photograph almost all of the stages of the monarch butterfly’s lifecycle.

They remind us what a gift it is to be alive.</h3>
